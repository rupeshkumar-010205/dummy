# Setting Up Conda Environment

This guide will help you set up a Conda environment using the `environment.yml` file available in this repository.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your machine. You can download them from the following links:
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

## Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RUPESH-KUMAR01/yolo_v8.git
   cd yolo_v8
Here is the markdown code for the steps to create a Conda environment using an environment.yml file:

## Creating the Conda Environment

1. Navigate to the directory containing the `environment.yml` file. Open the environment.yml file in a text editor and find the name field. Replace the value of name with your desired environment name. The file should look something like this:

    ```yaml
    name: your-environment-name
    channels:
    - defaults
    dependencies:
    - python=3.8
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    ```
3. Create the Conda environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

## Activating the Conda Environment

1. After the environment is created, activate it using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda activate your-environment-name
   ```

   Replace `your-environment-name` with the name of the environment specified in the `environment.yml` file.

## Verifying the Installation

1. To ensure that all packages are installed correctly, you can list all the installed packages in the environment using:

   ```bash
   conda list
   ```

### Additional Commands

#### Deactivating the Environment

To deactivate the current environment, use:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

#### Removing the Environment

If you need to remove the environment, use:

```bash
conda env remove -n your-environment-name
```

Replace `your-environment-name` with the name of the environment you want to remove.
